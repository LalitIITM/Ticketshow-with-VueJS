# My SPA App Frontend

Welcome to the frontend codebase of My SPA ' TICKETSHOW' App. This application is built using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework, and communicates with the backend APIs to provide a user-friendly Single Page Application.

## Project Structure

The frontend is organized into several folders and files:

- `public/`: Contains the main `index.html` file.
- `src/`: Holds the main source code of the Vue.js application.
  - `assets/`: Stores static assets like images.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable Vue components for different parts of the application.
  - `views/`: Contains high-level Vue components that represent different views or pages.
  - `App.vue`: The root component of the application.
  - `main.js`: Entry point of the application.
- `vue.config.js`: Configuration file for Vue CLI.
- `package.json`: Lists all the dependencies and project details.
- `README.md`: Provides information about the frontend setup and usage.
